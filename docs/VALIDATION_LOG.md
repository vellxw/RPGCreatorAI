## Phase 2 — Visible Playable RPG Runtime MVP

### Run 1 — initial Phase 2 validation

- Command: `build_bootstrap.bat` (configures via `cmake`, builds via
  `cmake --build`, runs `ctest`)
- Result: ALL PASSED
- Build output: `[317/317] Linking CXX executable rpg_creator_runtime.exe`
- Test output: `1/1 Test #1: RPGTests ......... Passed 0.21 sec — 100% tests passed, 0 tests failed out of 1`
- Warnings: doctest C5285 (std::tuple specialization) — known third-party
  warning, harmless under MSVC 19.51 / C++20.
- Fix applied: none required.
- Final: PASS.

### Run 2 — runtime smoke

- Command: launch `build\rpg_creator_runtime.exe` for 4 seconds, capture
  stdout/stderr.
- stdout:
  - `[INFO] RPG Creator Runtime starting...`
  - `[INFO] Project loaded: Demo RPG`
  - `[INFO] Map loaded: town`
- stderr: empty
- Process status: still alive after 4 s; window opened titled
  "Demo RPG"; killed cleanly.
- Final: PASS.

## Phase 1 — Bootstrap

### Run — bootstrap configure/build/ctest

- Command: `build_bootstrap.bat`
- Result: ALL PASSED
- ctest: `1/1 Test #1: RPGTests ......... Passed 0.17 sec`
- Final: PASS (Phase 1 commit `41273a8`).

## Phase 2 Visual Verification

### Run — `--smoke-shots` deterministic harness

- Command: `build\rpg_creator_runtime.exe --smoke-shots docs\screenshots\phase-2`
- Result: PASS — exit 0, 9 screenshots written, full event trace captured.
- Trace (relevant log lines):
  - `[INFO] Map loaded: town`
  - `[INFO] Dialogue [Anciano]: No cruces el puente de noche.`
  - `[INFO] Map loaded: house`
  - `[INFO] Dialogue: Encontraste una pocion.`
  - `[INFO] playSound: chest_open`
  - `[INFO] Dialogue: El cofre esta vacio.`
  - `[INFO] Game saved to saves/slot_1.json`
  - `[INFO] Map loaded: town` (transfer back)
  - `[INFO] Game loaded from saves/slot_1.json`
  - `[INFO] Map loaded: house` (load restored map)
  - `[INFO] Dialogue: Partida cargada.`
- Pixel verification (see `docs/PHASE_2_VISUAL_VERIFICATION.md`):
  dialogue-edge pixel ratio jumps from 0.04% (idle) to ≥0.58% (dialogue
  frames); ground/wall ratios swap between town and house palettes;
  NPC red appears only on town frames; chest orange only on house
  frames.
- Final: PASS.

### Run — full validation after harness changes

- Command: `build_bootstrap.bat`
- Build: 317/317 link OK.
- Tests: `1/1 Test #1: RPGTests ......... Passed 0.15 sec — 100% tests passed`.
- Final: PASS.

## Phase 4 — Editor Persistence & Runtime Bridge

**Date**: 2026-05-15

### Commands run

| Command | Result | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| `npx tsc --noEmit` | PASS | 0 errors |
| `npx vite build` | PASS | 290 KB JS bundle, 18.29s |
| `npx vitest run` | PASS | 32 / 32 tests |
| `cmd /c build_bootstrap.bat` | BLOCKED | Pre-existing OneDrive file-lock during FetchContent rename. No C++ files were modified in Phase 4. |

### Fix applied
- The C++ build failure is environmental (OneDrive holds locks on `build/_deps/` during cmake's directory rename). Documented in `docs/PHASE_4_VALIDATION_REPORT.md` with workaround suggestions. No code changes required for Phase 4.

### Final pass/fail
- Frontend: PASS
- C++ runtime: unmodified, build blocked by OneDrive sync (not a Phase 4 regression)

## Phase 4.1 — Validation Hardening & Desktop Bridge Preparation

**Date**: 2026-05-15

### Commands run

| Command | Result | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| `npx tsc --noEmit` | PASS | exit 0 |
| `npx vite build` | PASS | 290 KB JS, 16s |
| `npx vitest run` | PASS | 32/32 tests |
| `scripts\dev\verify-runtime.bat` | PASS | configure + build + ctest, build dir `%LOCALAPPDATA%\RPGCreatorAI\build` |
| `scripts\dev\verify.ps1` (full incl. smoke) | PASS | runtime stays alive 3s, [INFO] Project loaded, [INFO] Map loaded |

### Fixes applied
- Replaced `New-TemporaryFile` in `scripts/dev/verify.ps1` with `[System.IO.Path]::GetTempFileName()` to remove a Windows PowerShell version dependency.
- Defaulted CMake binary dir to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\RPGCreatorAI\build` across `verify.ps1`, `verify-runtime.bat`, and `build_bootstrap.bat` so FetchContent rename steps no longer collide with OneDrive's filter driver.
- Added new `scripts/dev/verify-runtime.bat` for a pure-cmd path (no PowerShell required).
- Updated `smoke-runtime.ps1` to accept `-BuildDir`, run from repo root for `data/` lookups, and use ASCII-only status output.

### Final pass/fail
- Frontend: PASS
- C++ runtime: PASS
- Smoke: PASS
- OneDrive lock issue: RESOLVED via out-of-OneDrive build directory
